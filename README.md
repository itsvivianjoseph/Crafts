# ðŸš€ CRAFTS

This repository serves as a practice project for mastering the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The primary goal is to enhance skills and understanding of each technology in the stack.

**Note:** ðŸ›‘ This repository is intended for personal practice purposes only. Once the project is completed to satisfaction, the codebase will be refined, optimized, and moved to a separate repository in my GitHub profile for long-term storage.

## Project Structure

- `/server`: Node.js server using Express.js and MongoDB for the backend.
- `/client`: React application for the frontend.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the codebase, make improvements, and learn from it. However, keep in mind that this repository will be deleted once the practice is concluded.

## Branches

The repository has three branches for different skill levels:

- `basic`: Projects at a beginner level.
- `intermediate`: Intermediate-level projects.
- `advanced`: Advanced-level projects.

Choose the branch that aligns with your current skill level and progressively move to the next level as you gain expertise.

## Future Steps

Upon completion of the practice, the refined and polished codebase will be moved to a dedicated repository in my GitHub profile.

ðŸš€ Happy coding!
